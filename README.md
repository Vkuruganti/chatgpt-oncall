## LLM System
The LLM (Learning Incident Lifecycle Management) System is a tool designed to assist Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in managing on-call incidents effectively. It provides a framework for capturing, analyzing, and learning from incidents, facilitating incident resolution and knowledge sharing.

## Features
- Create incidents with title, description, severity, and assignment.
- Update incident status.
- Retrieve incidents by ID, open incidents, or incidents assigned to a specific user.
- Getting Started
- Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.0 or higher)

### Getting Started

# Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.0 or higher)

## Installation
Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-system.git
- cd llm-system
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python llm_system.py


Usage

from llm_system import LLMSystem
Create an instance of the LLMSystem class:

python
Copy code
llm = LLMSystem()
Use the available methods to manage incidents:

python
Copy code
# Create an incident
llm.create_incident(title, description, severity, assigned_to)

# Update incident status
llm.update_incident_status(incident_id, new_status)

# Retrieve incidents
incident = llm.get_incident_by_id(incident_id)
open_incidents = llm.get_open_incidents()
assigned_incidents = llm.get_assigned_incidents(assigned_to)
